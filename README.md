# Adventure-Cycles-Power-BI

In this Project I have created the Report for Adventure cycles Organisation.

I have used the raw data csv files and transformed the data using power query.

Also inserted new calcualted columns and DAX Measures to get more insights from data.

Developed model view and edited the relationships b/w different tables.

At last created the report from all the Measures and metrics we had.

Utilised the KPI Cards, Charts, Matrix, Drilldowns,Slicers, Guage charts etc..
